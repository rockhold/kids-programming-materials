# HTML Basics
Slides for learning about the basics of HTML can be viewed [here](http://bit.ly/2sLGGNz). To recreate the example web page on your local computer, just [download these files](https://github.com/rockhold/kids-programming-materials/archive/master.zip) and open the `index.html` file in a browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer). At this point, we will have only really covered the HTML portion of the content, so the files in the `css` and `js` folders can be ignored for now.
